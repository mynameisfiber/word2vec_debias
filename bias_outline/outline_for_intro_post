    List a few of the decisions that algorithms are now starting to make:
        - Credit Decision
        - Work etc 


    This has caught the attention of several researchers in the machine learning
    domain as well as other areas. 
        List of potential work in this areas. 

    Further the government has also noted the need to ensure that AI/ML does not
    increase discrimination.

    In this blog post, we'll survey this emerging field and highlight recent
    work in this area as well as research directions.
